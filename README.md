## 🔒 Privacy & Security

**Your data stays on your device. We don't store anything.**

- ✅ **API keys are stored locally** in your browser's Chrome sync storage only
- ✅ **No data collection** — we don't track, store, or transmit any of your personal information
- ✅ **No server required** — all processing happens in your browser
- ✅ **Direct API calls** — your OpenAI API key is sent directly to OpenAI's API, never through any intermediate server
- ✅ **Open source** — you can review all the code to verify our privacy claims
- ✅ **No analytics** — we don't use any tracking or analytics services

**We have zero access to:**

- Your OpenAI API key
- Your tweets or replies
- Your personal context or settings
- Any data from X/Twitter

Everything is stored locally in your browser and only you have access to it.

## 🚀 Usage

### Using AI Reply Suggestions

1. **Navigate to X (Twitter):**

   - Go to [x.com](https://x.com) and log in

2. **Open a reply composer:**

   - Click the reply button on any tweet
   - The reply composer will open

3. **Find the AI Reply button:**

   - Look for the green **AI Reply** button near the composer actions (usually next to the "Post" button)
   - The button appears automatically when you open a reply composer

4. **Generate a reply:**

   - Click the **AI Reply** button
   - The X ViewLess modal will open
   - The AI will immediately start generating a suggested reply based on:
     - The tweet you're replying to
     - The author's username and display name
     - Your default tone and style settings
     - Your personal context (if configured)

5. **Customize the reply:**

   - **Tone**: Change between Neutral, Friendly, or Dry Sarcastic
   - **Style**: Adjust between Short, Medium, or Spicy
   - **Allow longer**: Uncheck to enforce your character limit
   - **Regenerate**: Click to generate a new reply with the same settings

6. **Edit if needed:**

   - The generated reply is editable — feel free to modify it
   - The textarea supports full editing

7. **Insert and post:**
   - Click **Insert into X** to paste the reply into the composer
   - Review the reply in the composer
   - Post when ready!

### Using View Count Hiding

1. **Enable the feature:**

   - Go to extension options
   - Check "Hide view counts on my own posts"
   - Save settings

2. **How it works:**

   - View counts on your own posts will be automatically hidden
   - A toggle button (👁️) will appear where the view count was
   - Click the button to temporarily show the view count
   - Click again to hide it

3. **Privacy benefit:**
   - Reduces anxiety from constantly checking view counts
   - Helps you focus on creating content rather than metrics

## 📝 Important Notes

- **This extension uses the OpenAI API directly** — it does not use ChatGPT consumer or ChatGPT Memories
- The **Personal Context** setting is your replacement for "memory" in this extension
- Your API key is stored locally in Chrome's sync storage and is never shared
- API usage will be billed to your OpenAI account according to their pricing
- The extension works entirely client-side — no data leaves your browser except API calls to OpenAI

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured" error

- **Solution**: Open the extension options and enter your OpenAI API key
- Make sure you've saved the settings after entering the key

### Button not appearing

- **Solution**: Refresh the page; X's UI is dynamic and the observer may need a moment to detect the composer
- Try closing and reopening the reply composer
- Make sure you're on x.com (not twitter.com)

### Reply not inserting

- **Solution**: Try clicking inside the composer first, then use "Insert into X"
- If that doesn't work, the reply is copied to your clipboard — just paste it manually (Cmd+V / Ctrl+V)

### View counts not hiding

- **Solution**: Make sure "Hide view counts" is enabled in settings
- Refresh the page after enabling the setting
- The feature only works on your own posts

### AI replies not generating

- **Solution**: Check that your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Verify your internet connection
- Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
